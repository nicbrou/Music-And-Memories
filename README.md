# **MUSIC AND MEMORIES (FOR SENIORS)**

## Inspiration

In my previous career, I worked as a music therapist with seniors in long term care facilities, many of whom were living with dementia. It can be difficult to connect with someone living with dementia but when I would sing or play one of their favourite songs, the seniors were often able to recall the words and sing along as well as memories related to the songs.
