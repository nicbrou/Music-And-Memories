# **MUSIC AND MEMORIES (FOR SENIORS)**

## Inspiration

In my previous career, I worked as a music therapist with seniors in long term care facilities, many of whom were living with dementia. It can be difficult to connect with someone living with dementia but when I would sing or play one of their favourite songs, the seniors were often able to remember the words and sing along as well as recall and share memories related to the songs.

## General Overview

"Music and Memories (For Seniors)" is a tool for people who spend time with or work with seniors. The app uses a Spotify API and suggests music by the senior's music preferences and the decade they were born in.

The user is then able to save playlists onto their "Saved Music" page. Once a playlist is there they are able to create a note, and delete it.

## Data Entities

The main functional idea of the app is that each unique user has a 1:M relationship with their suggested playlists based on what they input when they create their account.

The second data entity is the 1:M embedded relationship each

## Special Conditions

Only if a user has an account and they are logged in, can they access the music suggestions page and save music to their "Saved Music" Page.
